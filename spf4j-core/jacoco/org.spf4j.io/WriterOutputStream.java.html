/**
 * {@link OutputStream} implementation that transforms a byte stream to a
 * character stream using a specified character set encoding and writes the resulting
 * stream to a {@link Writer}. The stream is transformed using a
 * {@link CharsetDecoder} object, guaranteeing that all character set
 * encodings supported by the JRE are handled correctly.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The output of the {@link CharsetDecoder} is buffered using a fixed size buffer.
 * This implies that the data is written to the underlying {@link Writer} in chunks
 * that are no larger than the size of this buffer. By default, the buffer is
 * flushed only when it overflows or when {@link #flush()} or {@link #close()}
 * is called. In general there is therefore no need to wrap the underlying {@link Writer}
 * in a {@link java.io.BufferedWriter}. {@link WriterOutputStream} can also
 * be instructed to flush the buffer after each write operation. In this case, all
 * available data is written immediately to the underlying {@link Writer}, implying that
 * the current position of the {@link Writer} is correlated to the current position
 * of the {@link WriterOutputStream}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * {@link WriterOutputStream} implements the inverse transformation of {@link java.io.OutputStreamWriter};
 * in the following example, writing to {@code out2} would have the same result as writing to
 * {@code out} directly (provided that the byte sequence is legal with respect to the
 * character set encoding):
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * OutputStream out = ...
 * Charset cs = ...
 * OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(out, cs);
 * WriterOutputStream out2 = new WriterOutputStream(writer, cs);&lt;/pre&gt;
 * {@link WriterOutputStream} implements the same transformation as {@link java.io.InputStreamReader},
 * except that the control flow is reversed: both classes transform a byte stream
 * into a character stream, but {@link java.io.InputStreamReader} pulls data from the underlying stream,
 * while {@link WriterOutputStream} pushes it to the underlying stream.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Note that while there are use cases where there is no alternative to using
 * this class, very often the need to use this class is an indication of a flaw
 * in the design of the code. This class is typically used in situations where an existing
 * API only accepts an {@link OutputStream} object, but where the stream is known to represent
 * character data that must be decoded for further use.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Instances of {@link WriterOutputStream} are not thread safe.
 * 
 * @see org.apache.commons.io.input.ReaderInputStream
